                    Note that a spend limit of 0 is effectively no limit, and should only be used to reset or remove a prior limit. Only a limit of 1 or above will result in declined transactions due to checks against the account limit. This behavior differs from the daily spend limit and the monthly spend limit.

      summary: Initiate account holder document upload
      description: |
        Use this endpoint to identify which type of supported government-issued documentation you will upload for further verification.
        It will return two URLs to upload your document images to - one for the front image and one for the back image.

        This endpoint is only valid for evaluations in a `PENDING_DOCUMENT` state.

        Uploaded images must either be a `jpg` or `png` file, and each must be less than 15 MiB. Once both required uploads have been successfully completed, your document will be run through KYC verification.

        If you have registered a webhook, you will receive evaluation updates for any document submission evaluations, as well as for any failed document uploads.

        Two document submission attempts are permitted via this endpoint before a `REJECTED` status is returned and the account creation process is ended. Currently only one type of
        account holder document is supported per KYC verification.

      summary: Create webhook for KYC/KYB events
      description: |
        Create a webhook to receive KYC or KYB evaluation events.

        There are two types of account holder webhooks:
          - `verification`: Webhook sent when the status of a KYC or KYB evaluation changes from `PENDING_DOCUMENT` (KYC) or `PENDING` (KYB) to `ACCEPTED` or `REJECTED`.
          - `document_upload_front`/`document_upload_back`: Webhook sent when a document upload fails.

        After a webhook has been created, this endpoint can be used to rotate a webhooks HMAC token or modify the registered URL. Only a single webhook is allowed per program. Since HMAC verification is available, the IP addresses from which KYC/KYB webhooks are sent are subject to change.

      description: |
        Authorization Stream Access (ASA) provides the ability to make custom transaction approval decisions through an HTTP interface to the ISO 8583 message stream.

        ASA requests are delivered as an HTTP POST during authorization. The ASA request body adheres to the Lithic transaction schema, with some additional fields added for use in decisioning. A response should be sent with HTTP response code 200 and the approval decision in the response body. This response is converted by Lithic back into ISO 8583 format and forwarded to the network.

        In Sandbox, users can self-enroll and disenroll in ASA. In production, onboarding requires manual approval and setup.

      summary: Embedded card UI
      description: |
        Handling full card PANs and CVV codes requires that you comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Some clients choose to reduce their compliance obligations by leveraging our embedded card UI solution documented below.

        In this setup, PANs and CVV codes are presented to the end-user via a card UI that we provide, optionally styled in the customer's branding using a specified css stylesheet. A user's browser makes the request directly to api.lithic.com, so card PANs and CVVs never touch the API customer's servers while full card data is displayed to their end-users. The response contains an HTML document. This means that the url for the request can be inserted straight into the `src` attribute of an iframe.

        ```html
        <iframe id="card-iframe"
                src="https://sandbox.lithic.com/v1/embed/card?embed_request=eyJjc3MiO...;hmac=r8tx1..."
                allow="clipboard-write" class="content"></iframe>
        ```

        You should compute the request payload on the server side. You can render it (or the whole iframe) on the server or make an ajax call from your front end code, but **do not ever embed your API key into front end code, as doing so introduces a serious security vulnerability**.

            The endpoint returns an HTML document similar to the one below. It is up to the API client to provide css styles for these elements in the EmbedRequest. You can always rely on the `card`, `pan`, `expiry`, `cvv`, and `alert` ids, as well as the `pan-separator` class. You shouldn't make any other assumptions about the structure of the document as it could change at any time.

            Note that using the default style sheet there is no visual indication that copying is happening on-click, and you may need to add on-click styling yourself.

            This field partially maps to the `transStatus` field in the [EMVCo 3-D Secure specification](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/) and Mastercard SPA2 AAV leading indicators.

            Verification result values:
            * `CANCELLED`: Authentication/Account verification could not be performed, `transStatus = U`.
            * `FAILED`: Transaction was not authenticated. `transStatus = N`, note: the utilization of exemptions could also result in `transStatus = N`, inspect the `acquirer_exemption` field for more information.
            * `FRICTIONLESS`: Attempts processing performed, the transaction was not authenticated, but a proof of attempted authentication/verification is provided. `transStatus = A` and the leading AAV indicator was one of {`kE`, `kF`, `kQ`}.
            * `NOT_ATTEMPTED`: A 3-D Secure flow was not applied to this transaction. Leading AAV indicator was one of {`kN`, `kX`} or no AAV was provided for the transaction.
            * `REJECTED`: Authentication/Account Verification rejected; `transStatus = R`. Issuer is rejecting authentication/verification and requests that authorization not be attempted.
            * `SUCCESS`: Authentication verification successful. `transStatus = Y` and leading AAV indicator for the transaction was one of {`kA`, `kB`, `kC`, `kD`, `kO`, `kP`, `kR`, `kS`}.

        The request timeout is configurable per request, with a default of 5 seconds. Response before the timeout does not guarantee that the authorization will succeed.

        ## AVS Matching
        AVS response is optional. If AVS is present and a response is not received, Lithic will return AVS validated. If AVS attributes aren’t included in the authorization, any AVS response result will be ignored.

        ## Returned Balances
        BALANCE_INQUIRY ASA messages require a settled and available amount to be returned. If no balance is returned, Lithic will return $0 for both attributes.

                Partial approval is when part of a transaction is approved and another
                payment must be used for the remainder.
                Example scenario: A $40 transaction is attempted on a
                prepaid card with $25 balance. If partial approval is enabled,
                $25 can be authorized, at which point the POS will prompt
