        Retrieve the status of account holder document uploads, or retrieve the upload URLs to process your image uploads.

        Note that this is not equivalent to checking the status of the KYC evaluation overall (a document may be successfully uploaded but not be sufficient for KYC to pass).

        In the event your upload URLs have expired, calling this endpoint will refresh them.
        Similarly, in the event a previous account holder document upload has failed, you can use this endpoint to get a new upload URL for the failed image upload.

        When a new document upload is generated for a failed attempt, the response will show an additional entry in the `required_document_uploads` list
        in a `PENDING` state for the corresponding `image_type`.

        Use this endpoint to identify which type of supported government-issued documentation you will upload for further verification.
        It will return two URLs to upload your document images to - one for the front image and one for the back image.

        This endpoint is only valid for evaluations in a `PENDING_DOCUMENT` state.

        Uploaded images must either be a `jpg` or `png` file, and each must be less than 15 MiB. Once both required uploads have been successfully completed, your document will be run through KYC verification.

        If you have registered a webhook, you will receive evaluation updates for any document submission evaluations, as well as for any failed document uploads.

        Two document submission attempts are permitted via this endpoint before a `REJECTED` status is returned and the account creation process is ended. Currently only one type of
        account holder document is supported per KYC verification.

      summary: Request authorization rule performance report
      description: |
        Requests a performance report of an authorization rule to be asynchronously generated. Reports can only be run on rules in draft or active mode and will included approved and declined statistics as well as examples.
        The generated report will be delivered asynchronously through a webhook with `event_type` = `auth_rules.performance_report.created`. See the docs on setting up [webhook subscriptions](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/events-api).

        Reports are generated based on data collected by Lithic's authorization processing system in the trailing week. The performance of the auth rule will be assessed on the configuration of the auth rule at the time the report is requested.
        This implies that if a performance report is requested, right after updating an auth rule, depending on the number of authorizations processed for a card program, it may be the case that no data is available for the report. Therefore Lithic recommends to decouple making updates to an Auth Rule, and requesting performance reports.

        To make this concrete, consider the following example:
        1. At time `t`, a new Auth Rule is created, and applies to all authorizations on a card program. The Auth Rule has not yet been promoted, causing the draft version of the rule to be applied in shadow mode.
        2. At time `t + 1 hour` a performance report is requested for the Auth Rule. This performance report will *only* contain data for the Auth Rule being executed in the window between `t` and `t + 1 hour`. This is because Lithic's transaction processing system will only start capturing data for the Auth Rule at the time it is created.
        3. At time `t + 2 hours` the draft version of the Auth Rule is promoted to the active version of the Auth Rule by calling the `/v2/auth_rules/{auth_rule_token}/promote` endpoint. If a performance report is requested at this moment it will still only contain data for this version of the rule, but the window of available data will now span from `t` to `t + 2 hours`.
        4. At time `t + 3 hours` a new version of the rule is drafted by calling the `/v2/auth_rules/{auth_rule_token}/draft` endpoint. If a performance report is requested right at this moment, it will only contain data for authorizations to which both the active version and the draft version is applied. Lithic does this to ensure that performance reports represent a fair comparison between rules. Because there may be no authorizations in this window, and because there may be some lag before data is available in a performance report, the requested performance report could contain no to little data.
        5. At time `t + 4 hours` another performance report is requested: this time the performance report will contain data from the window between `t + 3 hours` and `t + 4 hours`, for any authorizations to which both the current version of the authorization rule (in enforcing mode) and the draft version of the authorization rule (in shadow mode) applied.

        Note that generating a report may take up to 15 minutes and that delivery is not guaranteed. Customers are required to have created an event subscription to receive the webhook.
        Additionally, there is a delay of approximately 15 minutes between when Lithic's transaction processing systems have processed the transaction, and when a transaction will be included in the report.

      description: |
        Handling full card PANs and CVV codes requires that you comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Some clients choose to reduce their compliance obligations by leveraging our embedded card UI solution documented below.

        In this setup, PANs and CVV codes are presented to the end-user via a card UI that we provide, optionally styled in the customer's branding using a specified css stylesheet. A user's browser makes the request directly to api.lithic.com, so card PANs and CVVs never touch the API customer's servers while full card data is displayed to their end-users. The response contains an HTML document. This means that the url for the request can be inserted straight into the `src` attribute of an iframe.

        ```html
        <iframe id="card-iframe"
                src="https://sandbox.lithic.com/v1/embed/card?embed_request=eyJjc3MiO...;hmac=r8tx1..."
                allow="clipboard-write" class="content"></iframe>
        ```

        You should compute the request payload on the server side. You can render it (or the whole iframe) on the server or make an ajax call from your front end code, but **do not ever embed your API key into front end code, as doing so introduces a serious security vulnerability**.

            The endpoint returns an HTML document similar to the one below. It is up to the API client to provide css styles for these elements in the EmbedRequest. You can always rely on the `card`, `pan`, `expiry`, `cvv`, and `alert` ids, as well as the `pan-separator` class. You shouldn't make any other assumptions about the structure of the document as it could change at any time.

            Note that using the default style sheet there is no visual indication that copying is happening on-click, and you may need to add on-click styling yourself.

        If you are configured for ASA, simulating authorizations requires your ASA client to be set up properly, i.e. be able to respond to the ASA request with a valid JSON. For users that are not configured for ASA, a daily transaction limit of $5000 USD is applied by default. You can update this limit via the [update account](https://docs.lithic.com/reference/patchaccountbytoken) endpoint.

        A paused token will prevent merchants from sending authorizations, and is a temporary status that can be changed.

    post:
      description: The `three_ds_authentication.challenge` event. Upon receiving this request, the Card Program should issue the requested Challenge Method to the CardHolder. After a cardholder challenge is successfully completed, the cardholder must navigate back to the merchant checkout flow to complete the transaction. Some merchants will include an app_requestor_url for app-based purchases; Lithic recommends triggering a redirect to that URL after the cardholder completes an app-based challenge.

            * `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later time.
            * `PENDING_FULFILLMENT` - The initial state for cards of type `PHYSICAL`. The card is provisioned pending manufacturing and fulfillment. Cards in this state can accept authorizations for e-commerce purchases, but not for "Card Present" purchases where the physical card itself is present.
            * `PENDING_ACTIVATION` - At regular intervals, cards of type `PHYSICAL` in state `PENDING_FULFILLMENT` are sent to the card production warehouse and updated to state `PENDING_ACTIVATION` . Similar to `PENDING_FULFILLMENT`, cards in this state can be used for e-commerce transactions. API clients should update the card's state to `OPEN` only after the cardholder confirms receipt of the card.

            In sandbox, the same daily batch fulfillment occurs, but no cards are actually manufactured.

                  The following attributes may be targeted:
                  * `MCC`: A four-digit number listed in ISO 18245. An MCC is used to classify a business by the types of goods or services it provides.
                  * `COUNTRY`: Country of entity of card acceptor. Possible values are: (1) all ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes, (2) QZZ for Kosovo, and (3) ANT for Netherlands Antilles.
                  * `CURRENCY`: 3-digit alphabetic ISO 4217 code for the merchant currency of the transaction.
                  * `MERCHANT_ID`: Unique alphanumeric identifier for the payment card acceptor (merchant).
                  * `DESCRIPTOR`: Short description of card acceptor.
                  * `LIABILITY_SHIFT`: Indicates whether chargeback liability shift to the issuer applies to the transaction. Valid values are `NONE`, `3DS_AUTHENTICATED`, or `TOKEN_AUTHENTICATED`.
                  * `PAN_ENTRY_MODE`: The method by which the cardholder's primary account number (PAN) was entered. Valid values are `AUTO_ENTRY`, `BAR_CODE`, `CONTACTLESS`, `ECOMMERCE`, `ERROR_KEYED`, `ERROR_MAGNETIC_STRIPE`, `ICC`, `KEY_ENTERED`, `MAGNETIC_STRIPE`, `MANUAL`, `OCR`, `SECURE_CARDLESS`, `UNSPECIFIED`, `UNKNOWN`, `CREDENTIAL_ON_FILE`, or `ECOMMERCE`.
                  * `TRANSACTION_AMOUNT`: The base transaction amount (in cents) plus the acquirer fee field in the settlement/cardholder billing currency. This is the amount the issuer should authorize against unless the issuer is paying the acquirer fee on behalf of the cardholder.
                  * `RISK_SCORE`: Network-provided score assessing risk level associated with a given authorization. Scores are on a range of 0-999, with 0 representing the lowest risk and 999 representing the highest risk. For Visa transactions, where the raw score has a range of 0-99, Lithic will normalize the score by multiplying the raw score by 10x.
