        Create an account holder and initiate the appropriate onboarding workflow.  Account holders and accounts have a 1:1 relationship. When an account holder is successfully created an associated account is also created.
        All calls to this endpoint will return a synchronous response. The response time will depend on the workflow. In some cases, the response may indicate the workflow is under review or further action will be needed to complete the account creation process.
        This endpoint can only be used on accounts that are part of the program that the calling API key manages.

        Update the information associated with a particular account holder (including business owners and control persons associated to a business account).
        If Lithic is performing KYB or KYC and additional verification is required we will run the individual's or business's updated information again and return whether the status is accepted or pending (i.e., further action required).
        All calls to this endpoint will return a synchronous response. The response time will depend on the workflow. In some cases, the response may indicate the workflow is under review or further action will be needed to complete the account creation process.
        This endpoint can only be used on existing accounts that are part of the program that the calling API key manages.

        Retrieve the status of account holder document uploads, or retrieve the upload URLs to process your image uploads.

        Note that this is not equivalent to checking the status of the KYC evaluation overall (a document may be successfully uploaded but not be sufficient for KYC to pass).

        In the event your upload URLs have expired, calling this endpoint will refresh them.
        Similarly, in the event a previous account holder document upload has failed, you can use this endpoint to get a new upload URL for the failed image upload.

        When a new document upload is generated for a failed attempt, the response will show an additional entry in the `required_document_uploads` list
        in a `PENDING` state for the corresponding `image_type`.

        Use this endpoint to identify which type of supported government-issued documentation you will upload for further verification.
        It will return two URLs to upload your document images to - one for the front image and one for the back image.

        This endpoint is only valid for evaluations in a `PENDING_DOCUMENT` state.

        Uploaded images must either be a `jpg` or `png` file, and each must be less than 15 MiB. Once both required uploads have been successfully completed, your document will be run through KYC verification.

        If you have registered a webhook, you will receive evaluation updates for any document submission evaluations, as well as for any failed document uploads.

        Two document submission attempts are permitted via this endpoint before a `REJECTED` status is returned and the account creation process is ended. Currently only one type of
        account holder document is supported per KYC verification.

                    * `ISSUER_REQUEST` - The issuer has initiated the closure of the account due to business strategy, risk management, inactivity, product changes, regulatory concerns, or violations of terms and conditions.
                    * `NOT_ACTIVE` - The account has not had any transactions or payment activity within a specified period. This status applies to accounts that are paused or closed due to inactivity.
                    * `INTERNAL_REVIEW` - The account is temporarily paused pending further internal review. In future implementations, this status may prevent clients from activating the account via APIs until the review is completed.
                    * `OTHER` - The reason for the account's current status does not fall into any of the above categories. A comment should be provided to specify the particular reason.

    post:
      summary: Request a backtest
      description: |
        Initiates a request to asynchronously generate a backtest for an Auth rule. During backtesting, both the active version (if one exists) and the draft version of the Auth Rule are evaluated by replaying historical transaction data against the rule's conditions. This process allows customers to simulate and understand the effects of proposed rule changes before deployment.
        The generated backtest report provides detailed results showing whether the draft version of the Auth Rule would have approved or declined historical transactions which were processed during the backtest period. These reports help evaluate how changes to rule configurations might affect overall transaction approval rates.

        The generated backtest report will be delivered asynchronously through a webhook with `event_type` = `auth_rules.backtest_report.created`. See the docs on setting up [webhook subscriptions](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/events-api).
        It is also possible to request backtest reports on-demand through the `/v2/auth_rules/{auth_rule_token}/backtests/{auth_rule_backtest_token}` endpoint.

        Lithic currently supports backtesting for `CONDITIONAL_BLOCK` / `CONDITIONAL_ACTION` rules. Backtesting for `VELOCITY_LIMIT` rules is generally not supported. In specific cases (i.e. where Lithic has pre-calculated the requested velocity metrics for historical transactions), a backtest may be feasible. However, such cases are uncommon and customers should not anticipate support for velocity backtests under most configurations.
        If a historical transaction does not feature the required inputs to evaluate the rule, then it will not be included in the final backtest report.

      summary: Retrieve backtest results
      description: |
        Returns the backtest results of an Auth rule (if available).

        Backtesting is an asynchronous process that requires time to complete. If a customer retrieves the backtest results using this endpoint before the report is fully generated, the response will return null for `results.current_version` and `results.draft_version`. Customers are advised to wait for the backtest creation process to complete (as indicated by the webhook event auth_rules.backtest_report.created) before retrieving results from this endpoint.

        Backtesting is an asynchronous process, while the backtest is being processed, results will not be available which will cause `results.current_version` and `results.draft_version` objects to contain `null`.
        The entries in `results` will also always represent the configuration of the rule at the time requests are made to this endpoint. For example, the results for `current_version` in the served backtest report will be consistent with which version of the rule is currently activated in the respective event stream, regardless of which version of the rule was active in the event stream at the time a backtest is requested.

        Convert a virtual card into a physical card and manufacture it.
        Customer must supply relevant fields for physical card creation including `product_id`, `carrier`, `shipping_method`, and `shipping_address`.
        The card token will be unchanged.  The card's type will be altered to `PHYSICAL`.
        The card will be set to state `PENDING_FULFILLMENT` and fulfilled at next fulfillment cycle.
        Virtual cards created on card programs which do not support physical cards cannot be converted.  The card program cannot be changed as part of the conversion.  Cards must be in an `OPEN` state to be converted.
        Only applies to cards of type `VIRTUAL` (or existing cards with deprecated types of `DIGITAL_WALLET` and `UNLOCKED`).

        Handling full card PANs and CVV codes requires that you comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Some clients choose to reduce their compliance obligations by leveraging our embedded card UI solution documented below.

        In this setup, PANs and CVV codes are presented to the end-user via a card UI that we provide, optionally styled in the customer's branding using a specified css stylesheet. A user's browser makes the request directly to api.lithic.com, so card PANs and CVVs never touch the API customer's servers while full card data is displayed to their end-users. The response contains an HTML document (see Embedded Card UI or Changelog for upcoming changes in January). This means that the url for the request can be inserted straight into the `src` attribute of an iframe.

        ```html
        <iframe id="card-iframe"
                src="https://sandbox.lithic.com/v1/embed/card?embed_request=eyJjc3MiO...;hmac=r8tx1..."
                allow="clipboard-write" class="content"></iframe>
        ```

        You should compute the request payload on the server side. You can render it (or the whole iframe) on the server or make an ajax call from your front end code, but **do not ever embed your API key into front end code, as doing so introduces a serious security vulnerability**.

            The endpoint returns an HTML document similar to the one below. It is up to the API client to provide css styles for these elements in the EmbedRequest. You can always rely on the `card`, `pan`, `expiry`, `cvv`, and `alert` ids, as well as the `pan-separator` class. You shouldn't make any other assumptions about the structure of the document as it could change at any time.

            Note that using the default style sheet there is no visual indication that copying is happening on-click, and you may need to add on-click styling yourself.

    post:
      description: |
        Return an ACH payment with a specified return reason code. Returns must be initiated
        within the time window specified by NACHA rules for each return code (typically 2 banking
        days for most codes, 60 calendar days for unauthorized debits). For a complete list of
        return codes and their meanings, see the [ACH Return Reasons documentation](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/ach-overview#ach-return-reasons).

        Note:
          * This endpoint does not modify the state of the financial account associated with the payment. If you would like to change the account state, use the [Update financial account status](https://docs.lithic.com/reference/updatefinancialaccountstatus) endpoint.
          * By default this endpoint is not enabled for your account. Please contact your implementations manager to enable this feature.

        Simulates an authorization request from the card network as if it came from a merchant acquirer.
        If you are configured for ASA, simulating authorizations requires your ASA client to be set up properly, i.e. be able to respond to the ASA request with a valid JSON. For users that are not configured for ASA, a daily transaction limit of $5000 USD is applied by default. You can update this limit via the [update account](https://docs.lithic.com/reference/patchaccountbytoken) endpoint.

                    * `BALANCE_INQUIRY` is a $0 authorization requesting the balance held on the card, and is most often observed when a cardholder requests to view a card's balance at an ATM.
                    * `CREDIT_AUTHORIZATION` is a dual message request from a merchant to authorize a refund, meaning a subsequent clearing step is required to settle the transaction.
                    * `FINANCIAL_AUTHORIZATION` is a single message request from a merchant to debit funds immediately (such as an ATM withdrawal), and no subsequent clearing is required to settle the transaction.
                    * `FINANCIAL_CREDIT_AUTHORIZATION` is a single message request from a merchant to credit funds immediately, and no subsequent clearing is required to settle the transaction.

These identifiers often link together events within the same transaction lifecycle and can be used to locate a particular transaction, such as during processing of disputes. Not all fields are available in all events, and the presence of these fields is dependent on the card network and the event type. If the field is populated by the network, we will pass it through as is unless otherwise specified.

  three_ds_authentication.challenge:
    post:
      description: The `three_ds_authentication.challenge` event. Upon receiving this request, the Card Program should issue its own challenge to the cardholder. After a cardholder challenge is successfully completed, the Card Program needs to respond back to Lithic by call to [/v1/three_ds_decisioning/challenge_response](https://docs.lithic.com/reference/post_v1-three-ds-decisioning-challenge-response). Then the cardholder must navigate back to the merchant checkout flow to complete the transaction. Some merchants will include an `app_requestor_url` for app-based purchases; Lithic recommends triggering a redirect to that URL after the cardholder completes an app-based challenge.
